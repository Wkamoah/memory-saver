# 🖼️ Memory Saver

A simple web application that allows users to upload an image, attach a short note, and save it locally in the browser. Designed to help track personal experiences, memories, or creative ideas — all in one visual space.

This project is part of my learning journey as a front-end developer. I'm using it to practice how users can interact with a site by uploading media and adding data. In the near future, I plan to extend this project with a Firebase backend for real-time data persistence and user authentication.
